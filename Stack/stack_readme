STACK ADT :
1. LIFO { Last In First Out } Similar to a stack of plates in the cafeteria. 
The one kept at the bottom at first cant be removed unless the top plates are removed
2. Implementation can be done as an array or a list
3. Main Functions :
    a. PUSH( X ) : Pushing Element X onto the stack
    b. POP (  ) : Always pops out the top most Element
    c. Peek() : Always tells the topmost element of the stack, without removing it 
    d. IsEmpty( ) : informs if the stack is empty 

4. TO DO:
    Implementation with Queue
    2 stacks in an array
    Designa  stack that supports getMin in o(1) time and space complexity
    implement stack with priorityu queue or heap
    Infix to Postfix using stack
    prefix to Infix
