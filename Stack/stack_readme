STACK ADT :
1. LIFO { Last In First Out } Similar to a stack of plates in the cafeteria. 
The one kept at the bottom at first cant be removed unless the top plates are removed
2. Implementation can be done as an array or a list
3. Main Functions :
    a. PUSH( X ) : Pushing Element X onto the stack
    b. POP (  ) : Always pops out the top most Element
    c. Peek() : Always tells the topmost element of the stack, without removing it 
    d. IsEmpty( ) : informs if the stack is empty
